## **Title of the project:** 
The GreedyGoblins Newsletter.

## **Project Description:** 
This is a school project from the course version control where we are collaborating to finish up a newsletter assignment. We are getting data from the newsletterAPI: "https://newsapi.org". We are currently 5 members working on this, trying to push and pull code without breaking the repository. This project has teached us how to divide and conquer assignments in the project in an effective way. The project itself is rather basic. We have a button that you click to render x amount of articles, containing a title, author, description, img and a link to the full article. The site also consists of a navbar where you can navigate to pages like "Contact Us" & "About Us".   

## **Members:**
